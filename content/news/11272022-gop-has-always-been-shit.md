People get confused. Too many people think that the GOP has a Donald Trump problem. Wrong. Trump is but another symptom of an underlying disease that has infected the GOP for at least 60 years.

Mother Jones' David Corn [has a great piece](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/09/it-didnt-start-with-trump-the-decades-long-saga-of-how-the-gop-went-crazy/) detailing the racist, homophobic, disgusting Republican party going back to the 1950s and Joe McCarthy.

One of the more sickening aspects of this dynamic is that Democratic leadership doesn't get it, or won't admit it.

Corn recalled in May when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Cali.) wondered aloud about the Republican Party.

"I want the Republican Party to take back the party," Pelosi said, "take it back to where you were when you cared about a woman's right to choose, you cared about the environment ... this country needs a strong Republican Party. ... Not a cult. But a strong Republican Party."

It's a problem that the Democratic Party elders think that the Republican Party which coined the phrase "welfare queen" is what we seek to restore. Pelosi is wrong. We don't want the Republican Party that embraces a "southern strategy" to appeal to white racists to win elections.

The GOP has been a total shit show my entire life, pretending this nightmare is all Trump's doing is borderline criminal.

What we need now are leaders, not boot-lickers and fascist appeasers.
