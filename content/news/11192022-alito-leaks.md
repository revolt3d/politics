The New York Times is reporting today that Conservative Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito leaked to a group of evangelicals how the court was going to rule on a 2014 contraception case.

The case was Burwell v. Hobby Lobby. The recipients of Alito's dinner table leak were wealthy evangelical donors. Those donors reportedly tipped off the CEO of Hobby Lobby ahead of the court's ruling.
