Outspoken journalist Grant Wahl died covering the World Cup of an aneurysm in his heart.

"Grant died from the rupture of a slowly growing, undetected ascending aortic aneurysm with hemopericardium," Grant's wife Dr. Celine Gounder wrote [on her husband's substack](https://grantwahl.substack.com/p/a-note-from-grants-wife-celine-gounder).

What a tragic loss for Grant Wahl's family and friends. At only 49 years old, Wahl had more to do on this rock. Rest in peace, Mr. Wahl. You left a mark.

Grant Wahl is dead. The sportswriter collapsed while covering the World Cup in Qatar on Friday. Was Wahl murdered?

At the beginning of this year's World Cup, Wahl was barred entry to the World Cup because he was wearing a t-shirt with a rainbow on it. 

There has been no cause of death reported yet. I'm certain toxology hasn't been completed yet. However, no one should assume Wahl wasn't poisoned. He had been reportedly feeling unwell for several days, and sought medical help the Monday before he died.

Wahl's brother told NPR, "[Grant] was very critical of FIFA - which is not new for him and very critical how the Qataris were running the games."

I will be following this story and providing updates here.
