Tom Engelhardt wrote a [lengthy story in The Nation](https://www.thenation.com/article/environment/climate-change-midterms-election-2022/) this week wondering why climate change wasn't a big issue in the mid-term elections.

Here's why climate change doesn't register in our elections in the US. We have two political parties: Democrats and Republicans. The Republicans love burning fossil fuel and pissing all over the planet. It makes them wildly wealthy and powerful to do so. The Democrats also have gotten fat off fossil fuels, and they're uncomfortable bucking the fossil fuel industry for fear of losing voters, money and power. 

It's true that Biden has gotten some things done to help the environment. However, you will never see footabe of Democratic party leaders speaking passionately about combatting climate change. Look at how they speak about the Green New Deal. Democrats see this issue as a loser for them, and they're probably not wrong.

In a nation where most people can't be bothered to use a turn signal while driving, do we really think we're going to do anything useful about climate change? We're literally the lobster taking a nice bath in a pot of water on a stovetop. We think we're having a spa day.

Without bold leadership, and the Democratic party willing to put their electoral asses on the line, we're going to let this bitch burn.

The time to act to save the planet was 20 years ago. The next best time, is right now, but people need to stop accepting mediocrity.
