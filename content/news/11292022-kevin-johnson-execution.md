The state of Missouri is proven to be racist - a system of racial oppression. No government in this country should have the power to kill people, but certainly not government of Missouri.

Today, Missouri is scheduled to execute Kevin Johnson - a black man. All appeals and pleas for clemency have fallen on deaf ears.

While there are some people who clearly deserve to be killed for their heinous acts of violence, there are others who might have been railroaded by a bunch of racists. The best policy is to not kill people, then you don't have to feel bad about it when you kill the wrong person.
