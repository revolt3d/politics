Last night it happened again. A lunatic with a gun shot 23 innocent and unsuspecting people at Club Q in Colorado Springs. Of those shot, 5 of them are dead.

At around midnight Saturday, a shooter opened fire on the gay night club. No motive is yet known to the public. At this point, it's just one more random act of senseless violence directed at the gay community. 

The reason this violence doesn't end is because no one is trying to end it. Far too many unstable people own guns in this country. And when one of the two political parties openly hates gay people and speaks and behaves violently, this is what happens.
