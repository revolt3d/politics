I'm not going to predict the complete and total collapse of the Republican Party - not yet. Powerful people control the GOP, and could somehow course correct the party, but that's not currently happening.

Week after week, sometimes day after day, there is more bad news for the Republican party. It was only a couple of weeks ago when the FBI executed a search warrant of Trump's home and recovered classified and top secret documents. A criminal investigation is underway. Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special prosecutor to run this and other investigations involving the Republican Party's leader.

In last month's elections, Democrats absolutely crushed it. Yes, they barely lost the House, but it shouldn't have been even close. The GOP is so weak right now that even with high inflation, and people generally pissed off, they still can't leverage that in an off-year election. The results aren't in yet, but it looks like Democrats will add a seat in the Senate.

Now Kevin McCarthy is in a knife fight with a member of his own party to see who will become the next House Speaker. It doesn't appear that this challenger to McCarthy has the power to beat McCarthy for the top spot, but it shows how fractured and weak the GOP is right now.

## Here's the Problem for the GOP
The problems in the GOP run deeper than Donald Trump, but Trump is a serious, immediate problem for the party.

Even if the party elders wanted to somehow get rid of Trump - politically - they don't really have a way to do it. Trump doesn't command the entire Republican Party, but he does command a chunk of it. Without that chunk, the GOP isn't going to see another Republican president anytime soon.

Trump doesn't care about the Republican Party. Trump cares about Trump. Trump is both making money off of Republican voters and getting his ego stroked at the same time. There's no way Trump is walking away from that kind of money - not in a million years. Even if the conservative elite are moaning about Trump privately, there is nothing they can do to stop him.

And while Trump won't be around forever, Trumpism (a.k.a. fascism) is here to stay, until WE do something about it. I recommend, isolation, marginalization and a complete rejection of fascists. Fascists aren't legit participants in a democracy - they're a threat.

For example, today families of police officers killed on January 6 stood up against the fascists and the liars.
