Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Cali.) lambasted Trump over his treason, and Trump's attempt to overturn the will of the people. Schiff got into the fake electoral college electors scheme. Schiff spoke about Trump's brutal attacks on innocent election workers. People lives were turned upside down by Trump and his thugs.

Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Illinois) detailed how Trump leaned on the Department of Justice to legitimize Trump's election fraud claims. Trump sought to put a puppet to lead the DoJ to pressure on states to overturn the results of the election.

Rep. Aguilar reminded us of the pressure Trump put on Vice President Mike Pence to reject the electoral college votes. Aguilar praised Pence for not doing what Trump wanted him to do. He didn't mention the level of effort Pence put into considering whether he could legally do what Trump wanted of him. Pence even called former Vice President Dan Quayle in search of legal justification to overturn the results of the presidential election. Had Pence found a legal path to do what Trump wanted him to do, he would have done it.
