![Democrat Raphael Warnock Victory Speech Georgia Senate](%assets_url%/2022-warnock-victory-speech.jpg)

Democrat Raphael Warnock crushed Republican Hershel Walker like a bug in this week's runoff election.

I use the word "crushed" because a couple of years ago any talk of a black Democrat repping Georgia in the senate was laughable. But thanks to the hard work of black Democrats in Georgia like Stacey Abrams and others, Georgia is turning blue, at least for statewide races, like for the senate and the president.

It's not just that Democrats in Georgia are amazing - they are - it's also that the Republican party is a legit shit show. Walker was a horrible candidate. The former football player didn't even live in Georgia. He still files taxes as a Texas resident, where he's lived for more than 15 years. Warnock should have beaten Walker in the general election by 5 points or better.

This is why Warnock called out voter suppression during his victory speech.

"Let me be clear," Warnock said, "the fact that millions of Georgians endured hours in lines, and were willing to spend hours in line — lines that wrapped around buildings and went on for blocks, lines in the cold, lines in the rain — is most certainly not a sign voter suppression does not exist."

Had the Republican party put up a halfway decent candidate, Warnock probably would have lost. I predicted that Warnock wouldn't win the general election.

Interestingly though, GOP attempts in Georgia to suppress the vote may have actually energized people to vote who might not have done so in a mid-term election.

But in the end, the results from Warnock's win are a mixed bag. 

On one hand, it's amazing that Warnock will represent Georgia in the senate for 6 years. 

On the other hand, Walker was too close to beating Warnock. The race should not have been so tight to even trigger a run-off.

Warnock gives Democrats a true majority in the senate, therefore passing voting rights and protecting women must be the top priorities. 

FWIW, the senate can pass bills on its own, and send them to the House. The GOP House can choose to not pass these bills, but make them say no to women and voting and the climate and whatever. Democratic leadership needs to make the GOP House caucus hate everything about their jobs.
