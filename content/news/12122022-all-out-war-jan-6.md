The war has begun, or maybe it never ended. Either way, January 6, 2021 will go down in the history books as the first shots fired in our civil war.

It doesn't matter if you believe this to be true. It doesn't matter if Democratic leadership understands the situation. The facts are the facts - the civil war has begun.

On Saturday, Southern Povery Law Center's Hannah Gais and Michael Edison Hayden reported on a white nationalist gathering in New York on Friday hosted by the New York Republicans Club.

"We want to cross the Rubicon. We want total war. We must be prepared to do battle in every arena. In the media. In the courtroom. At the ballot box. And in the streets," NYYRC president Gavin Wax told the gala attendees on the Upper East Side - swank.

Congressperson Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) told the crowd that had she organized the violent coup on January 6 the rioters "would've been armed."

And the rhetorical response by Democratic leadership has been luke warm.

President Biden and dem leadership universally make a distinction between the so-called "good Republicans" and the "extreme MAGA Republicans." 

"What we're seeing now is either the beginning or the death knell of extreme MAGA philosophy," [Biden told](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/25/biden-trump-philosophy-semi-fascism-00053831) Democratic donors in the Washington suburb of Rockville in August 2022. "It's not just Trump, it's the entire philosophy that underpins the — I'm going to say something, it's like semi-fascism."

Joe "Fund the Police" Biden will not passionately shout down fascists. In his mind, this was Biden speaking with strength. There are not "good Republicans." One can't be half-of-a-fascist. The Republican Party is the party of fascism. It doesn't matter if you like the party's position on global trade, fossil fuel, etc. - the GOP is the party of fascists. Nothing they do is legit.

## Is McConnell One of the Good Republicans?

In August, Biden was still publicly wondering if what's happening with the GOP and fascism is the end of extreme ideology. He doesn't get it, or he doesn't want to talk about it honestly, either way, it's bad for us. 

As this gala in New York shows, these powerful people are not backing down. Yes, Democrats didn't get trounced in last month's elections, but the fascists still control the Supreme Court, now the US House, and many state governments. So any fantasies about the fascists getting bored and quitting are delusional at best. 

To stop fascists, you actually have to stop them. Hope and wishful thinking isn't going to get it done.
