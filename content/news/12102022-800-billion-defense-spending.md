To the untrained eye, it may appear that DC Democrats and DC Republicans are on polar opposites of the political spectrum.

That's not really true though. Just look at abortion. Republicans want to ban abortion - period. Democrats might do something to protect women later. Both party's positions leaves women not free.

It's the same for this latest defense spending bill. Both parties agree that they should approve $45 billion more than President Biden asked for. And why not? That's free money to them that they can give to their buddies - the military industrial complex.

This bill is a crime. They're stealing our money. While we're all struggling to make ends meet, in DC they're spending money like drunken sailors.
