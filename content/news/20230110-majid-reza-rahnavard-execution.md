On December 12, 2022, Majid Reza Rahnavard, 23, was executed by the government of Iran.

Just three days after the hanging of [Mohsen Shekari](12082022-mohsen-shekari-execution), Rahnavard was too hanged by the neck until dead.

At the time of this posting, January 10, a total of four men have been known to be executed stemming from the protests in September over the government's killing of Mahsa Amini.

[Amnesty International has called Rahnavard's, and the other trials as shams](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/12/iran-public-execution-of-majidreza-rahnavard-exposes-authorities-revenge-killings/). Rahnavard was convicted of "waging war against God." He was the second man executed, and the first to be executed in public.
