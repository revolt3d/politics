It happened again today, like it happens every time I consume mainstream media - I was lied to.

On NPR this morning, one of their "reporters" was "reporting" on politics in DC - Democrats versus the Republicans. Specifically, they were discussing a poll which shows that a majority of Americans want both parties to compromise. A majority also believes that the parties won't compromise. 

The NPR reporter went on to explain that bipartisanship is impossible because "both parties" are so entrenched in their extreme positions.

Is that true though? Has the Democratic party been taken over by radical leftists, hellbent on saving the planet, combatting income equality and realizing true freedom for everyone? 

I don't see that happening. I see Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Steny Hoyer and Joe Biden. These are not radical leftists. The guy they just tapped to be speaker of the House is definitely not a leftist - he has specifically called out that fact publicly.

It's different on the Republican side. The Republican party leader is Donald Trump. Trump has committed many felonies against this country, including January 6. The party leadership is determined to end democracy in this country. The GOP and Trump have worked directly with our enemies, such as Putin, to destroy democracy in our country. 

[Just last weekend](12122002-all-out-war-jan-6), Republicans spoke proudly about how the next time they launch a coup, they're bringing more guns. 

You won't hear any of this while consuming mainstream press. They are literally lying to you. It's not even journalism. It's disinformation. This is why I don't donate to NPR and I don't subscribe to mainstream press services.
