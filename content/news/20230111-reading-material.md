This is just a list of some reading material I've come across this week. I can't read it all right now, but hopefully I'll remember to come back and keep reading some of this fascinating history.

Karl Widerquist, Georgetown University, has [a bunch of interesting work to read](https://works.bepress.com/widerquist/). However, I've been reading this book "[The Prehistory of Private Property](https://works.bepress.com/widerquist/117/)."

[The Bonnot Gang: The Story Of The French Illegalists](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/richard-parry-the-bonnot-gang-the-story-of-the-french-illegalists). Richard Parry. 1987.

[To Remember Spain: The Anarchist and Syndicalist Revolution of 1936](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/murray-bookchin-to-remember-spain-the-anarchist-and-syndicalist-revolution-of-1936). Murray Bookchin. 1994.
