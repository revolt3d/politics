Our collective ability to diagnose what ails us is shockingly inadequate. Today, I heard a teaser for an NPR show about how the Internet is making us more divided as a country. 

That is one of the stupid things I've heard in a minute. 

Just look at our nation's history. We used to own slaves. Then we fought a bloody war over ending slavery. Then we had Jim Crow, and lynched thousands of black people. Women couldn't vote until the 20th century. Were we all getting along during the Red Scare era when "conservatives" brutalized so-called communists?

During all of this, no one had any idea what is an "internet."

The problem isn't that the internet allows us to communicate more efficiently and has lowered the cost to publish our ideas to near zero. The problem is that many people's ideas are awful. 

The remedy to bad ideas isn't to make it harder for people to publish and communicate - banning or restricting the internet. The solution is elevate the good ideas while shouting down the bad ones. 

Technological advancements are always a positive. Our focus should be on the humans who can't stop failing to use technology effectively.
