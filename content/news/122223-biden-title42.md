[Human Rights First](https://humanrightsfirst.org/about-us/) released a report this month claiming that the non-profit is aware of more than 13,000 reports of rape, murder, torture, kidnapping and other violent attacks against migrants and asylum seekers blocked from entry by Title 42. 

Title 42 is a border policy put in place by Donald Trump. It denies people their right to seek asylum. The Trump law has been ruled illegal, and the Biden administration has been ordered to end it. Biden has requested that the Supreme Court step in to keep Title 42 in place while Republican states challenge the lifting of Title 42.

Whatever happens with the court battles, the facts remain that Biden has sought to keep Title 42. The impact of Title 42 on people's lives has been enormous. Thousands are trapped in Mexico - victims. Others have tried to cross the border illegally and dangerously, only to die in the process. 

It was only a couple of weeks ago when I posted [this story about 4,000 dead crossing the southern border](https://1200tech.com/doy/politics/news/12082022-border-deaths). These border policies have real impact on people's lives. There's no reason we can't treat these people with dignity and respect.
