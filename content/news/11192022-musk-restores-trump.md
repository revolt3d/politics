Today, Elon Musk reinstated Donald Trump's Twitter account. 

Twitter was a toxic hellscape before Musk bought it. Now with Trump back, I'm really happy I deleted my account before the Musk deal went through. 

It's funny the people who remain on Twitter because they think doing so is some sort of act of resistance. It's not. Twitter is gone. What little power it awarded us was too much for the Elon Musks of the world. Twitter had to go, and so it goes.
