The UN climate change in Egypt wrapped up after 2 weeks with no plan to slow the use of fossil fuels now or in the future. 

The summit delegates agreed to fund a so-called "loss and damages" fund. The fund is expected to the help the Global South confront the impact of global climate change.

By creating this fund, the delegates admit that they - fossil fuel polluters - are responsible for harming the planet and destabilizing entire ecosystems.

However, the fossil fuel delegates decided that they would not take any steps to curb the use of fossil fuels. 

How can we sit here and do nothing? These people are literally going to let the planet burn, if it means that sweet, sweet oil money keeps flowing.
