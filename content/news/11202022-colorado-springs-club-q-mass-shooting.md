The person arrested for murdering five innocent people at Club Q in Colorado Springs has recently engaged in extremely violent behavior.

[NPR reported Dec. 9, 2022](https://www.npr.org/2022/12/09/1141803798/the-colorado-shooting-suspects-2021-case-dropped-for-lack-of-cooperation-da-says) that a court dismissed five felony charges four months before a gunman attacked Club Q.

After making bombthreats, the suspected Club Q shooter got into a lengthy standoff with police - grandparents were held as hostages. The prosecutor said they pursued the case, but the suspect's grandparents and mother refused to testify in court.

Had they done so, the shooter wouldn't have been a shooter, they would have been an inmate. But even after this violent hostage situation, there seemed to have been no attempt to get guns away from this person.

We're all just getting lucky that some madman with a gun doesn't gun us down where we stand - life in America.

Saturday, November 19, 2022, five innocent people were executed at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

The victims are Daniel Aston, Kelly Loving, Ashley Paugh, Derrick Rump, and Raymond Green Vance.

Daniel Aston, 28, worked at Club Q as a bartender and entertainer. People who knew Aston described him as a warm, kind and loving person. A trans man, Aston completed his transition in June. A friend said Aston "was a very warm person." Daniel Beehler [told the Gazette](https://gazette.com/news/club-q-victim-daniel-aston-drag-king-bartender-was-the-best-version-of-heaven/article_fe5cb4ec-6aa9-11ed-a7e6-0f796caaf928.html), "Sometimes I would come by the club on days when I knew hardly anyone would be there, just to have a conversation with Daniel. He was very proud of his whole life. He was proud of his job, and of the person he had become as a trans man, and he was happy to be surrounded by people who were completely accepting of it. You just felt a sense of pride around him.

"The fact that he died on or around (Transgender Day of Remembrance) is just tragic beyond belief."

Kelly Loving, 40, is a trans woman. Loving's sister told the New York Times, "She was loving, always trying to help the next person out instead of thinking of herself. She just was a caring person. I was really close with her."

Last night it happened again. A lunatic with a gun shot 23 innocent and unsuspecting people at Club Q in Colorado Springs. Of those shot, 5 of them are dead.

At around midnight Saturday, a shooter opened fire on the gay night club. No motive is yet known to the public. At this point, it's just one more random act of senseless violence directed at the gay community. 

The reason this violence doesn't end is because no one is trying to end it. Far too many unstable people own guns in this country. And when one of the two political parties openly hates gay people and speaks and behaves violently, this is what happens.
