Seven people were gunned down at a Walmart in Virginia yesterday. It was just a couple of days ago that a gunmen murdered 5 people at a gay club in Colorado. And before that 3 college students were gunned down in Virginia. 

The United States of America is a violent nation, and this holiday season is shaping up to be extremely violent. People are broke. People are scared. People are being lied to. People are being manipulated. These aren't excuses to justify this violence, these are facts. While it would be wonderful if we can fix the minds of millions of people, and get them to see things correctly, that's not possible. What is possible is to call out businesses and people who spread disinformation, hate and violence. There's only one Fox News. There's only one Alex Jones - the Sandy Hook families are showing us what we can do to these people.

We don't have to accept this violence, but we're not going to solve it by locking up the gunmen when they're done killing. We need to stop those who push hate and violence.
