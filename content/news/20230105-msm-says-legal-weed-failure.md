Check out my latest podcast. 

I only talk for like 6 minutes about mainstream media bullshit lies. In this episode, I talk about the legalization of weed and how the new industry has failed to transform our racist capitalist system into a system with true equality and equity for all. That's what the MSM wants you to believe. That the legalization of marijuana is a failure because the white supremacist power structures that have ruled this nation for centuries have not been destroyed by weed legalization. It's a distraction.

Also, you can listen to me thrash around with my Moog Mother-32 analog synth.
