The Supreme Court could rule democracy dead this year. The court has already made women in this country no longer free, so ending democracy isn't radical for this "conservative court."

The justices haven't ruled on this case - Moore v. Harper - yet. They're hearing arguments this week. The case revolves around this fringe "independent state" theory. 

In a nutshell, if the court rules in favor of the plaintiff, without strong federal legislation to protect our elections, many parts of this country will have a lot less democracy.

It is interesting in [this HuffPost story](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-independent-state-legislature-theory_n_6390fce8e4b0b72f15bfa03d), they brought it back to 2000. That was the year conservatives realized that they didn't need to win elections, they could steal them instead.

The debate largely revolved around the late Chief Justice William Rehnquistâ€™s 
concurrence in the 2000 Bush v. Gore case, which first surfaced the independent 
state legislature theory. Rehnquist argued that federal courts can intervene 
when state courts make novel interpretations of state constitutions in election 
law and redistricting cases.

Don't ever forget that George W. Bush was a fake ass president.
