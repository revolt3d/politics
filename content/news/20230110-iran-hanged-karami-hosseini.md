On Saturday, Iran's fascist government executed two more men over their participation in demonstrations following the killing of Mahsa Amini by the Iran government in September.

These two men were among four men sentenced death relating to a fatal assault on a Bansji agent on November 3. The international community doesn't consider these trials and convictions to be legitimate. These are extra-judicial executions carried out by an authoritarian radical regime in Iran which fears the people of Iran.

## Mohammad Mehdi Karami

Karami is a 21-year-old Iranian karate champion. According to Karami's father, his son was ranked fourth in the Iranian national karate team. 

On December 5, in a sham week-long "trial," Karami was sentenced to death. [Amnesty International described](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde13/6308/2022/en/) the trial as having "no resemblance to a meaningful judicial proceeding."

Karami's father spoke about his life following his son's arrest.

"I have not been able to work... I go to the court and prison every morning and then walk aimlessly in the streets. This morning I went to prison, but the assistant prosecutor stationed in prison was not there. They told me that I must stop going there if my case related to the protests. They do not give you any response. Every night I am terrified that they would give me the news of my childâ€™s execution. I have lost hope... they have sentenced my child to death and might carry out his execution any minute."

On Saturday morning, Karami's father got the news that his son had been executed - hanged by the neck until dead. The fascist government of Iran is scared of people like Karami - people who want to be free.

## Seyed Mohammad Hosseini

Hosseini, 20, was also convicted in a sham trial on December 5 with Karami. Hosseini was sentenced to death for "corruption on earth."

On December 18, 2022, Hosseini's lawyer tweeted the following.

Translation of above tweet to English.

"I met with Seyed-Mohammad Hosseini at Karaj Prison. He cried through his account of tortures, being beaten with tied hands and legs and blindfolded, to being kicked in the head and losing consciousness, the soles of his feet being beaten with an iron rod to being tased in different parts of the body."

Hosseini was executed on Saturday - hanged by the neck until dead. 

Little information about this young man's life is available online. A German parliamentarian who advocated for Hosseini said he volunteered with children as a coach.

Both of Hasseini's parents are dead. Hosseini was arrested on the way to his parent's grave along with his brother. His brother has not been heard from since the men were taken.
