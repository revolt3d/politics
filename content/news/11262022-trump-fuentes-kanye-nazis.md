Donald Trump reportedly had dinner with Kanye and some of his Nazi buddies this week, and Republicans are freaking out. 

NBC News' Marc Caputo reported, "If people are looking at DeSantis to run against Trump, here's another reason why."

Here's the problem with DeSantis, Trump will destroy him in about a week. Remember when Jeb! Bush had $100 million to take out Trump? I don't think he lasted 2 weeks. 

Lots of Republicans are shitting themselves after the party got their asses handed to them in November, however Trump poses several problems for the GOP.

First, Trump is vacuuming the bank accounts of Republican voters, and he's not sharing. That leaves a lot less money for the Republican Party.

Second, Trump has complete control of the GOP base of white nationalists, bigots, homophobes, incels and man-splainers. 

And, Trump doesn't give a shit about the Republican Party. GOP party leaders have no leverage over Trump. Trump is making tons of money and people gushing over his stupid ideas. There's no chance Trump decides to quit being Trump.

Trump will win the GOP nomination in 2024.
