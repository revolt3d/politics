Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Cali.) lambasted Trump over his treason, and Trump's attempt to overturn the will of the people. Schiff got into the fake electoral college electors scheme. Schiff spoke about Trump's brutal attacks on innocent election workers. People lives were turned upside down by Trump and his thugs.

Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Illinois) detailed how Trump leaned on the Department of Justice to legitimize Trump's election fraud claims. Trump eventually installed a puppet to lead the DoJ who did put pressure on states to overturn the results of the election. One has to wonder why this Clark criminal hasn't been arrested?
