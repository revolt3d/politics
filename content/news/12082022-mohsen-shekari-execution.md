This morning in Iran, Mohsen Shekari was hanged by the neck until dead. The fascist government of Iran executed this young man because he dared speak out against the Iranian government's violence and oppression. 

Shekari, 23, is one of 11 protesters sentenced to death following the murder of Mahsa Amini, 22, in September.

During the widespread protests, more than 18,000 have been arrested for the same crime as Shekari. The people of Iran are a threat to the religious fascists who rule Iran. The world needs to lean into this opportunity and free Iranians.
