Daniel Aston, 28, worked at Club Q as a bartender and entertainer. People who knew Aston described him as a warm, kind and loving person. A trans man, Aston completed his transition in June. A friend said Aston "was a very warm person." Daniel Beehler [told the Gazette](https://gazette.com/news/club-q-victim-daniel-aston-drag-king-bartender-was-the-best-version-of-heaven/article_fe5cb4ec-6aa9-11ed-a7e6-0f796caaf928.html), "Sometimes I would come by the club on days when I knew hardly anyone would be there, just to have a conversation with Daniel. He was very proud of his whole life. He was proud of his job, and of the person he had become as a trans man, and he was happy to be surrounded by people who were completely accepting of it. You just felt a sense of pride around him.

"The fact that he died on or around (Transgender Day of Remembrance) is just tragic beyond belief."

Kelly Loving, 40, whose sister described her as “caring and sweet”

Derrick Rump, 38, another club bartender known for his wit.

## Previous coverage
Last night it happened again. A lunatic with a gun shot 23 innocent and unsuspecting people at Club Q in Colorado Springs. Of those shot, 5 of them are dead.

At around midnight Saturday, a shooter opened fire on the gay night club. No motive is yet known to the public. At this point, it's just one more random act of senseless violence directed at the gay community. 

The reason this violence doesn't end is because no one is trying to end it. Far too many unstable people own guns in this country. And when one of the two political parties openly hates gay people and speaks and behaves violently, this is what happens.
