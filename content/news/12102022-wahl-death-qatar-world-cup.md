Wahl's brother Eric was in New York with his brother's body, which is expected to be headed to a medical examiner for an autopsy.

Grant Wahl is dead. The sportswriter collapsed while covering the World Cup in Qatar on Friday. Was Wahl murdered?

At the beginning of this year's World Cup, Wahl was barred entry to the World Cup because he was wearing a t-shirt with a rainbow on it. 

There has been no cause of death reported yet. I'm certain toxology hasn't been completed yet. However, no one should assume Wahl wasn't poisoned. He had been reportedly feeling unwell for several days, and sought medical help the Monday before he died.

Wahl's brother told NPR, "[Grant] was very critical of FIFA - which is not new for him and very critical how the Qataris were running the games."

I will be following this story and providing updates here.
