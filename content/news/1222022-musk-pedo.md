Elon Musk likes to accuse other men of pedophilia or harming children. 

Twitter's former head of trust and safety is now in hiding after Musk accused the man of sexualizing children online.

That wasn't true, but that didn't stop the throngs of bobbleheads who follow Musk from chasing this man from his own home.

Musk has a history of accusing people of harming children. Musk claims that the previous owners of Twitter "all belong in jail" for failing to take action against child exploitation on Twitter. Jack Dorsey, Twitter's former CEO, said that Musk's claims are "false."

Back in 2018, Musk accused an innocent man trying to help rescue children trapped in a mine in Thailand of pedophilia. Musk was pissed that the rescuers didn't want to use his stupid submarine, and so Musk lashed out at the man and called him "pedo guy." Musk was sued for this one, but he won in court because he said it wasn't a serious comment. Musk spent $50,000 to hire private investigator to dig up dirt on this random innocent person who happened into Musk's life - helping children.

I don't know anything about Musk, but I find it interesting that he seems to default to calling people pedophiles and child abusers.

In psychology there's a concept called "projection."

Psychological projection is an ego defense mechanism where unwanted thoughts, desires, motivations, attributes and feelings are attributed to others when they are actually attributable to oneself.
