It doesn't matter if it's Twitter or Facebook or Mastodon, what we currently call social networks is largely a shit show.

Most of the content on social networking is about one group of people trying to invalidate another group. It doesn't even matter if the two groups agree with each other. It's like the cool kids in high school versus the losers. And yes, I'm always in the latter, hence this story.

Social networks could actually be extremely powerful tools for people to organize. There have been times when this has happened. If we did more of that, we could actually put up a fight against the fascists and the elite who seek to control our lives. Instead, we too often use social networks to put other people down, to make ourselves seem greater than we are in real life. We use social networks to validate and justify ourselves. 

Many are fake activists. They're people on Mastodon and Twitter who think that their presence, their tweets and toots are what matters. By merely publishing their little messages they're making a difference - activism. And if anyone doesn't agree with their "ideas," they're invalid, a threat, an other to be silenced.

If you're smart, you'll realize that it's not the toots and tweets that matter. It's what people do in the real world to push for actual change. If social networks help people activate themselves in the real world, then they're useful. If it's just a bunch of fake "activists" puffing up their chests, I guess, I'd rather watch bass fishing.
