I recorded [a new episode of my sporadically produced podcast](https://soundcloud.com/user-920536464/msm-message-dont-indict-trump) - Explicit Podcast. It's largely me sparing my wife from listening to me bitch about politics. I like to keep it short, under 7 minutes.

In [this episode](https://soundcloud.com/user-920536464/msm-message-dont-indict-trump), I get into how the mainstream media is clearly pushing people to accept the idea that it would be bad for our country to indict Donald Trump for his crimes committed on January 6, 2021. 

They want us to believe that it's better to let insurrections be a thing that happens now. It's a new part of our political process. There isn't a peaceful transfer of power. We're supposed to accept this. We're supposed to accept people being killed by Trump and the Republican party as just more politics. It's certainly more exciting than a boring old ceremony that no one cares about - no clicks had there.

I hope we don't accept this violence. I hope we don't normalize fascism, but I fear that we are doing these things. This country seems to be sleepwalking into fascism. Too many people think that all of these fascists and nazis are a bunch of knuckleheads. And yes, the ones that the DoJ has rounded up, are largely a bunch of dipshits. However, they're not all dipshits, and funding these fascists are real people with real money and influence. People like the Mercers and other extremely wealthy sleazeballs.

The fascist threat is real. It's not just going to go away because Joe Biden got elected, Democrats held on to the Senate by a thread and only lost the House by a little bit.
